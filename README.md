# 🧠 LangGraph Agentic Workflow

A modular, agentic Python application built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). This project demonstrates how to construct stateful, multi-agent systems using graph-based execution for language models and tools.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository defines an **agentic workflow** using `LangGraph`, combining LLMs, memory, tools, and control logic into a dynamic graph-based architecture.

Key features:
- ✅ Agent nodes with memory and tool access
- 🔁 Looping and conditional flows
- 🔄 Stateful message passing
- 🧪 Pluggable tools (search, code, database, etc.)
